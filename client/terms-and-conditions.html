            <p class="paragraph-7">This Service Agreement contains the terms and conditions (the “Terms”) that govern
              the Services. The Client shall only provide access to the Services (as defined below) to authorized
              representatives who will be deemed to be acting on behalf of the Client. In the Terms, “the Client”,
              &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot; will collectively refer to the Client and its authorized
              representatives. Vrarify reserves the right to make non-material updates to this Agreement.</p>
            <h3 class="page-subtitle mt-50 font-20px mt-new-30 text-black text-medium">2. General description of the
              Services</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-7">AI Engineering Subscription Plans: Vrarify provides premium on-demand and fully
              managed AI engineering services. Depending on the number of subscriptions you have with us that will
              determine the number of AI Engineering Managers and AI Engineers assigned to you.</p>
            <h3 class="page-subtitle mt-50 font-20px mt-new-30 text-black text-medium">3. Change of Plan, Upgrades and
              Downgrades</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-7">The Client is entitled to upgrade the Plan during the Agreement Term. Downgrades and
              changes from one Plan to another Plan are only permitted from the next Agreement Term with a minimum
              thirty (30) days prior notice in writing. Such notices should be issued in writing to the AI Engineering
              Manager assigned to you. You are not allowed to pause a Plan. Notice to pause the Plan may be treated as
              notice of termination of such Plan. Changes that come into effect will continue to remain in effect for
              the following Agreement Term unless the notice explicitly states otherwise.</p>
            <h3 class="page-subtitle mt-50 font-20px mt-new-30 text-black text-medium">4. Term and Termination</h3>
            <ol role="list" class="paragraph-7 ol-a">
              <li class="list-item-3">This Agreement shall begin on the Start Date and, unless terminated earlier in
                accordance with these Terms, remain in effect for the duration of the Agreement Term.</li>
              <li class="list-item-3">Either party may terminate the Agreement in writing with immediate
                effect<br>where:</li>
              <li class="list-item-4">
                <ul role="list" class="list">
                  <li class="list-item-3">One party is in material breach of the Agreement (where the breach remains
                    even after the party in breach has been given thirty (30) calendar days to cure after first
                    receiving confirmed written notice of the breach);</li>
                  <li class="list-item-3">The party not seeking termination is insolvent or undergoing liquidation
                    proceedings; or</li>
                  <li class="list-item-3">In accordance with section 34 Force Majeure (each of (i), (ii) and (iii)a
                    “Termination for Cause”).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <ol start="3" role="list" class="paragraph-7 ol-a">
              <li class="list-item-3">This Agreement automatically renews for a new Agreement Term unless terminated in
                accordance with this Agreement.</li>
              <li class="list-item-3">Where notice of termination is given in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to
                the commencement of the next Agreement Term, the Plan will remain effective for the remainder of the
                current Agreement Term and subsequently be terminated at the end of the current Agreement Term. Where
                notice of termination is given less than thirty (30) days from the commencement of the next Agreement
                Term, the Plan will automatically renew and remain effective until the end of the next subsequent
                Agreement Term.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="page-subtitle mt-50 font-20px mt-new-30 text-black text-medium">5. Project Quality</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-7">Both parties must maintain clear and open communication regarding any delays,
              problems, or issues arising during the project. Recognizing the client&#x27;s limited technical expertise,
              it is agreed that the client cannot be held responsible for errors made by the developer. If the client is
              dissatisfied due to a technical issue attributable to the developer, the onus lies on the developer to
              rectify the problem without incurring additional costs for the client. If the issue proves insurmountable
              and significantly impacts the final product agreed upon by both parties, the client retains the right to
              terminate the agreement without liability for any associated hours. This will remain in effect for the
              specified project duration and applies to both parties and their respective successors, representatives,
              and assigns.</p>
            <h3 class="page-subtitle mt-50 font-20px mt-new-30 text-black text-medium">6. Pricing and Price Change</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-7">It is expressly agreed that the initially agreed-upon fees outlined in this agreement
              shall remain unchanged once both parties have signed, providing stability and predictability in financial
              commitments. Any alterations to the agreed-upon pricing necessitate written consent from both parties to
              ensure transparency and mutual agreement. This shall remain in effect for a specified duration and binds
              the parties and their respective successors, representatives, and assigns.</p>
            <h3 class="page-subtitle mt-50 font-20px mt-new-30 text-black text-medium">7. Refunds</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-7">Both parties commit to open and transparent discussions, acknowledging that clear
              communication is vital to resolving any potential issues and reaching a fair resolution. This will remain
              in effect for the agreed project duration and binds both parties, including their successors,
              representatives, and assigns.</p>
            <h3 class="page-subtitle mt-50 font-20px mt-new-30 text-black text-medium">8. Payment</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-7">The Agreement Term Amount will be automatically charged on the renewal date with the
              payment method on file, in accordance with the Billing Frequency, while this Agreement remains in
              effect.<br><br>Payment can be made with credit or debit card. The payment currency is USD. If any
              outstanding amount is more than thirty (30) days overdue from Payment Terms, Vrarify reserves the right to
              charge 1.5% interest per month on the outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is
              lower, plus all expenses of collection. Such outstanding amounts may be sent to a Debt Collection agency.
              You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with Services other than U.S. taxes based on Vrarifys
              net income.<br><br>Vrarify reserves the right to put Services on hold or terminate the Agreement with
              immediate effect should any outstanding amount be more than thirty (30)days overdue. Where Services are
              put on hold due to overdue outstanding amounts,<br>Vrarify shall be considered to be fulfilling the
              Service obligations in accordance with this Agreement and the Client will not be entitled to any relief
              for such action. Where the Agreement is terminated in accordance with this paragraph, the Client shall
              remain liable for all fees up until date of termination, plus any<br>Overage fees incurred. The fees for
              the then-current Agreement Term Amount shall be prorated for the period up until date of such termination.
            </p>
            <h3 class="page-subtitle mt-50 font-20px mt-new-30 text-black text-medium">9. Credit Card Payment Method
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph-7">The following applies to Clients who choose to use a Credit card as their payment
              method. Vrarify has integrated with Stripe, a validated Level 1 PCI DSS Compliant Service Provider, for
              PCI Compliant storing of credit card information and processing of payments. Stripe may make a temporary
              $1 charge to credit cards added to your Vrarify account. Any such charges are refunded after your credit
              card has been verified. The refund may take up to several business days depending on your bank or credit
              card service. Should you wish to use a Credit Card as a payment method, you hereby authorize Vrarify to
              run, or have run, credit card authorizations on all credit cards provided by you, to store credit card
              details as your method of payment for Services, and to charge your credit card (or any other form of
              payment authorized by Vrarify or mutually agreed to between you and Vrarify).</p>
            <h3 class="page-subtitle mt-50 font-20px mt-new-30 text-black text-medium">10. Restrictions of Use</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-7">This will underscore the client&#x27;s unequivocal entitlement to the source code
              without any restrictions. Both parties acknowledge and affirm that no limitations or encumbrances shall be
              imposed on the client&#x27;s access, use, or possession of the source code. This will serve to reinforce
              the commitment to transparency and client ownership, ensuring that the source code is provided to the
              client without any constraints as discussed during our video communications.</p>
            <h3 class="page-subtitle mt-50 font-20px mt-new-30 text-black text-medium">11. Confidentiality</h3>
